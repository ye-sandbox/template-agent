# NOTES.md — Active Contracts and Runtime Memory

> Stores the active runtime contracts (WHAT interacts with WHAT), live communication topology, and critical gotchas.
> Historical architectural decisions live in [`docs/adr/decisions.md`](../docs/adr/decisions.md).

## How to Use this File

1. **Read before planning.** Active contracts and gotchas here take precedence over unstated defaults.
2. **Keep this file lean:** Only store ACTIVE contracts, live topology, open technical debt, and critical gotchas.
3. **Architectural decisions:** Record in [`docs/adr/decisions.md`](../docs/adr/decisions.md). Do NOT accumulate historical decisions here to prevent context bloat.
4. **CRITICAL INVARIANT:** NEVER create task-specific headings (e.g., `## [Task XX.Y] Description` or `### [Task XX.Y]`) in `NOTES.md`. Task completion details live in `git log` and `.agent/ARCHIVE.md`. Architectural decisions live in `docs/adr/decisions.md`. In `NOTES.md`, maintain and update ONLY the live tables/lists of active contracts, interfaces, and topology.

## Active Contracts

### 1. Runtime Data & Payload Contracts

Full schemas live in code (`[src/models/]` or `[core/schemas/]`). This table maps high-level contracts:

| Channel / Route / Queue | Producer | Consumer | Payload Schema / Protocol | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[e.g.: GET /api/v1/items]` | `[Service API]` | `[Web Frontend]` | `[ItemSummaryResponse]` | `[Active pagination schema]` |
| `[e.g.: queue:events:raw]` | `[Ingestion Worker]` | `[Event Parser]` | `[RawEventPayload]` | `[Redis stream / Kafka topic]` |

Contract changes require updating schemas on both sides within the same task.

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration Contracts (Optional)

> Canonical 3-tier subagent topology, delegation micro-contracts, worktree isolation, and hermetic sandboxes. If operating single-agent, leave as default.

| Role | Interface / Channel | Responsibilities | Boundary & Invariants |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`Lead / Orchestrator`** | `.agent/TASK.md` / Interactive Prompt | Decomposes initiatives into wave-compatible tasks, manages task lifecycle, routes to model/quota tiers, interacts with human. | Sole manager of `TASK.md` and commit log. Does not run parallel worker tasks directly. |
| **`Worker / Implementer`** | Worktree / Target Workspace | Executes atomic code/doc changes strictly adhering to delegated micro-contract (`Read:`, `Paths:`, `Verify:`). | Restricted exclusively to `Paths:`. Adheres to DoD in `AGENTS.md`. |
| **`Reviewer / Sentinel`** | Diffs / Test Harness (`Verify:`) | Read-only inspection of diffs against task DoD, regression tests, and security blast radius. | Read-only; reports structured Pass/Fail diagnostic payload. |

#### Worktree Isolation & Dependency Bootstrap Contract

| Element | Protocol / Mechanism | Invariant / Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace Provisioning** | `git worktree add -b task-<id> <path> HEAD` | Default ephemeral path (`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/worktrees/task-<id>`) or `.worktrees/task-<id>` (`.worktrees/` in `.gitignore`). |
| **Dependency Bootstrap** | Fast-Link vs. Isolated-Install | Fast-Link (symlink `node_modules/` or `.venv/`) when `Paths:` has no manifest changes (<50ms, zero-copy). Isolated-Install when manifests change. |
| **Environment Injection** | Copy `.env` / `.env.example` to worktree | Ensures test harness execution without leaking uncommitted tokens or mutating root config. |
| **Teardown & GC** | `git worktree remove --force` + `branch -D` + `prune` | Immediate cleanup post-integration; trap declared in runners to prevent dangling worktree locks. |

#### Project Lifecycle Hooks & Fast-Link Bootstrap Contract

| Hook / Phase | Script Target | Invocation & Contract |
|---|---|---|
| **Fast-Link Bootstrap** | `bootstrap-worktree.sh` | Zero-copy symlinking of `node_modules/` and `.venv/`, `.env` isolation copy, `.agent/scratch/` provisioning. |
| **Post-Provisioning** | `.agent/hooks/post-worktree-create` | Executed post-bootstrap for test DB seeding, port binding, and ephemeral fixtures. Halts on non-zero exit. |
| **Pre-Verification** | `.agent/hooks/pre-verify` | Executed before `Verify:` command execution to ensure clean test state and fixture validation. |
| **Post-Teardown** | `.agent/hooks/post-worktree-teardown` | Executed prior to worktree removal (`git worktree remove`) for graceful daemon/resource teardown. |

#### Multi-Account Quota Routing & Failover Contract

| Element | Protocol / Mechanism | Invariant / Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Profile Routing Priority** | `select-profile.sh --exclude-current` | Autonomous workers route to secondary accounts with highest quota; active IDE profile reserved for Lead Orchestrator. |
| **Quota Floor Circuit Breaker** | `remaining_fraction <= 0.05` | Immediate disqualification of profiles with <=5% quota; halts execution if all candidate profiles are below floor. |
| **Model Tier Selection** | `gemini-3.8-flash-medium` | Low token footprint default; escalation to `gemini-4-argon-medium` permitted only for complex architecture or max 1 retry after verification failure. |
| **Cooldown Tracking** | `<profile>/.multigravity/quota-history.jsonl` | 429 rate limit backoff and cooldown persistence to prevent immediate re-dispatch. |
| **Worktree Recovery** | Worktree verify on timeout | Runs `Verify:` inside worktree on timeout; if code 0 and matches `Paths:`, recovers diff cleanly. |

#### Hermetic Agent Sandbox & Container Isolation Contract

| Element | Protocol / Mechanism | Invariant / Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1 (Bubblewrap)** | `bwrap --unshare-all --ro-bind /usr ...` | Rootless user namespace, read-only system binaries, ephemeral tmpfs `/tmp`, worktree read-write bind, `--die-with-parent`. |
| **Tier 2 (Rootless Container)** | `podman run --read-only --cap-drop=ALL` | Rootless OCI container, read-only rootfs, `no-new-privileges`, memory (2G) and CPU (2.0) limits, tmpfs `/tmp` with `noexec`. |
| **Network Namespacing** | `--unshare-net` / `--network none` | Hermetic air-gap by default; egress permitted exclusively for explicit external API or dependency fetching tasks. |
| **Fallback & Escalation** | `audit-command-security.sh` | Static pre-execution audit for hazardous commands (`sudo`, `/etc` writes, curl pipes) when namespaces unavailable. |
