# Procedure: Add or Update Service in Docker Compose

> 💡 **Objective:** Add or modify services in `compose.yaml` (or `docker-compose.yml`) idempotently and safely, avoiding port collisions and data loss risks.

---

## Prerequisites and Mandatory Invariants

1. **Prior Topology Review:** The agent MUST read [.agent/SERVICES.md](../../SERVICES.md) before modifying configuration.
2. **Pinned Images:** Tag `:latest` is forbidden. Always use stable semantic tags (e.g. `v1.2.3`, `1.23-alpine`) or SHA digests.
3. **Mandatory Healthcheck:** Every container must define an explicit `healthcheck` block.
4. **Resource Limits:** Every container must define CPU and memory limits (`cpus` and `memory`).
5. **Zero Plaintext Secrets:** Passwords and tokens must be injected via environment variables (`${VAR_NAME}`).

## Step-by-Step Procedure

### Stage 1: Port Availability Verification
1. Check the "Host Port Allocations" table in [.agent/SERVICES.md](../../SERVICES.md).
2. If exposing ports on the host, ensure the selected port is not already allocated.
3. On the local host (if shell commands are authorized), verify that the port is not bound by an external process:
   ```bash
   ss -tuln | grep ":<PORT>" || echo "Port available"
   ```

### Stage 2: Network Segregation & Storage Persistence
1. Determine network boundaries:
   - User-facing services connect to the reverse-proxy network (e.g. `proxy_public`).
   - Backend services (databases, queues, storage) reside exclusively on isolated networks (e.g. `db_isolated`).
2. Configure volumes:
   - For databases and high-write state, use **Named Volumes** declared in the root `volumes:` block of `compose.yaml`.
   - For static configuration files, use **Bind Mounts** with read-only `:ro` flags.

### Stage 3: Author Service Block in `compose.yaml`
Author the service block following canonical syntax:

```yaml
  service-name:
    image: vendor/image:v1.0.0
    container_name: service-name
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    networks:
      - proxy_public
      - monitoring_internal
    ports:
      - "${SERVICE_PORT:-8080}:8080"
    environment:
      - TZ=${TZ:-UTC}
      - APP_SECRET=${APP_SECRET}
    volumes:
      - service_data:/path/in/container
      - ./config/service.conf:/etc/service/service.conf:ro
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 20s
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 512M
```

### Stage 4: Update Environment Variables
1. Add new variables to `.env.example` with safe placeholder values.
2. Never commit production credentials to `.env.example`.

### Stage 5: Update `.agent/SERVICES.md`
1. Record the host port allocation in `.agent/SERVICES.md`.
2. Record volume persistence paths and UID:GID requirements.
3. Add the service definition to the services catalog.

### Stage 6: Syntax Validation & Idempotency
1. Validate Compose configuration syntax:
   ```bash
   docker compose config --quiet
   ```
2. If validation reports errors, correct formatting or missing variables before proceeding.
3. If authorized to launch:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d service-name
   docker compose ps service-name
   ```
