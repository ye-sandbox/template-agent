# [ARCH-000] [Architecture Document Title]

## 1. Context & Motivation
[Describe the engineering context, constraints, and problem statement motivating this architecture or topological design.]

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture & Topology

```text
[Insert ASCII / Mermaid diagram representing traffic flow, service boundaries, ports, and network segregation]
```

### Component Breakdown
- **Component / Service A:** [Role, network boundary, exposed ports]
- **Component / Service B:** [Role, internal dependencies, volume mounts]

---

## 3. Network & Storage Specifications

### Network Boundaries
- `proxy_public`: External ingress via reverse proxy
- `internal_backend`: Isolated overlay/bridge network for database and queues

### Persistent Storage & Volumes
- `named_volume`: Rationale for named volume vs bind mount, backup strategy, and UID requirements.

## 4. Operational Invariants & Security
- Resource limits (CPU/Memory)
- Healthcheck endpoints and criteria
- Secrets handling via `.env.example`
